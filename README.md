# Healthcare Analytics Engineer Handbook

This repo has all the resources you need to be a great Healthcare Analytics Engineer!

Please submit a pull request if there is any thing you'd like to contribute. Thanks!

## Getting started
I like the Data Roles Continuum created by [Zack Wilson](https://x.com/EcZachly/status/1853677599647736255). For pure data engineering stuff, check out his [Data Engineer Handbook](https://github.com/DataExpert-io/data-engineer-handbook).

Even though many people in Healthcare Analytics get called "data analysts" or "data scientists," a lot of what they do is actually "data engineering." So, they often end up working as "analytics engineers."

In any field, three key abilities are generally considered essential: business knowledge, soft skills, and hard skills.
